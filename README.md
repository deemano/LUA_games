#Three Educational and Cognitive-Enhancing Games
##Introduction
This project consists of three educational and cognitive-enhancing games that promote problem-solving skills, cognitive reflexes, and overall mental agility. All three are developed in the LUA programming language, with each game targeting distinct cognitive and educational objectives.

##Jigsaw Puzzle
The first game - Jigsaw Puzzle, is a timed puzzle assembly that seeks to bolster players' problem-solving abilities and spatial intelligence. By incorporating a timer, the game adds an element of urgency and motivates players to think critically and efficiently under pressure, simulating real-world scenarios where time-sensitive problem-solving is crucial.

##The Adventure
The second game - the Adventure, is a platformer that focuses on fostering hand-eye coordination, reflexes, and decision-making skills. As players navigate their character through the game environment, they must collect coins and avoid enemies, engaging their cognitive and motor skills in a fun, interactive manner. This game encourages players to learn from their mistakes and adapt their strategies, an essential component of growth and learning.

##CognitiveFlex
Lastly, the third game - CongnitiveFlex, is centred around a grid of 54 small square images, a few of which have subtle differences. By challenging players to identify these changes quickly against a timer, the game aims to enhance visual perception, attention to detail, and pattern recognition. Additionally, the game serves as a mental exercise in concentration and focus, essential skills for success in various educational and professional contexts.

##Conclusion
These three LUA games have been carefully designed to address different aspects of cognitive and educational development. By engaging players in diverse challenges that target problem-solving, cognitive reflexes, spatial intelligence, hand-eye coordination, and attention to detail, these games offer valuable opportunities for players to enhance their mental abilities in a fun and engaging way.
